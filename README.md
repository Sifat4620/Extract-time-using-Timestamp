# Extract time using Timestamp
Timestamps are typically in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and follow the ISO 8601 format. You can use a format like YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ, where:

YYYY is the year.
MM is the month.
DD is the day.
T is a literal 'T' that separates the date from the time.
HH is the hour in 24-hour format.
MM is the minutes.
SS is the seconds.
Z indicates UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
